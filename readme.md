### Abstract

Ischemic hepatitis (IH) is a liver injury from an underlying condition which reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the liver. The diagnosis is multifaceted and oftentimes requires time to eliminate the possibility of all other liver injuries. This data collected by Acute Liver Failure Study Group includes demographics, such as ethnicity, age, and gender, as well as biomarker peak values of creatinine, international normalized ratio, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin. Here, we utilize real-patient data with various random forests (RF) methods in attempt to create a strong predictive model for IH mortality. RF, adaptive boosting RF, and “clustered RF” models are compared. The clustered RF model employs a patient similarity index to partition the data, which we further analyze to better understand the magnitude of mortality risks associated with IH.
