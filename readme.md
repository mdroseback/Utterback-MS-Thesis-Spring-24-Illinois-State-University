### Abstract

Ischemic hepatitis (IH) is a liver injury from an underlying condition which reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the liver. This data collected by Acute Liver Failure Study Group includes demographics, such as ethnicity, age, and gender, as well as biomarker peak values of creatinine, international normalized ratio, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin. Here, we utilize real-patient data with various random forest (RF) methods in an attempt to create a strong predictive model for mortality of patients diagnosed with IH. RF, adaptive boosting RF, and “clustered RF” models are compared. The clustered RF model employs a patient similarity index to partition the data into two distinct clusters. After further analysis of the composition of the clusters, we found the most distinct features of the clusters were the average AST and ALT peak values which indicates these are important features when predicting IH patient mortality.
